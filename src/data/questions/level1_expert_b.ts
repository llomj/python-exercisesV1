    o: ["True", "False", "Error", "None"],

    e: "CPython caches small integers (-5 to 256), so id() returns the same value for 42.",
    de: `In CPython, small integers from -5 to 256 are cached (interned) as singleton objects. This means every reference to 42 points to the exact same object in memory, so id(42) returns the same integer both times.

Key Concepts:
• id() returns the unique identity (memory address) of an object
• Small integer caching is a CPython optimization, not a language guarantee
• The cache range is -5 to 256 inclusive
• Outside this range, integers may or may not be the same object

Example: id(42) == id(42) → True because 42 is within the cached range.

Key Concepts:
• See the key concepts and explanation above for the main ideas and bullet points.

Key Distinctions:
• Compare with related types (e.g. int vs float, str vs bytes) and similar operations or methods.
• Distinguish this operation or type from others that beginners might confuse (e.g. type() vs isinstance(), mutable vs immutable).

How It Works:
• Python evaluates the expression or literal first, then applies the operation (e.g. type(), method call, or built-in).
• The result is returned or produced according to the semantics of that operation.

Step-by-Step Execution:
1. Any literals or subexpressions in the expression are evaluated (e.g. the argument to type(), or the string before a method call).
2. The main operation is applied (type lookup, method invocation, or built-in function).
3. The operation completes and returns a value (or None, if applicable).
4. In the REPL or in an assignment, the result is displayed or stored.

Order of Operations:
1. Literals and innermost subexpressions are evaluated first, from left to right where applicable.
2. Method calls or function calls are evaluated: arguments are evaluated left to right, then the call is performed.
3. The operation completes and produces its return value.
4. No other operators or operands remain in this expression once the call finishes.
5. Display or use of the result happens after the full expression has been evaluated.

Common Use Cases:
• Checking types or results in the REPL; teaching the concept to beginners; validating data before use.
• Using this pattern in scripts to branch on type or to ensure correct behavior with different inputs.

Edge Cases:
• See the explanation above for edge cases (e.g. empty values, None, subclasses, encoding, or boundary conditions).
• Consider what happens with empty collections, missing keys, or invalid arguments where applicable.

Performance Considerations:
• The operation is typically fast at beginner scale; built-in types and methods are highly optimized in CPython.
• For hot paths, prefer isinstance() over type() when subclasses are allowed; avoid repeated type checks in tight loops when possible.

Examples:
• See the example(s) above; try the same pattern with related values or similar expressions to reinforce understanding.

Notes:
• Use isinstance() when you need to allow subclasses; follow PEP 8 for naming and style; refer to the official docs for full details.`

    de: `isinstance() can take a tuple of types as its second argument. It returns True if the object is an instance of any of the types in the tuple.

Key Concepts:
• isinstance(obj, (type1, type2, ...)) checks against multiple types
• Returns True if obj is an instance of any type in the tuple
• This is cleaner than: isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float)
• Works with any number of types in the tuple

Example: isinstance(42, (int, float)) → True because 42 is an int. isinstance("hi", (int, float)) → False.

Key Concepts:
• See the key concepts and explanation above for the main ideas and bullet points.

Key Distinctions:
• Compare with related types (e.g. int vs float, str vs bytes) and similar operations or methods.
• Distinguish this operation or type from others that beginners might confuse (e.g. type() vs isinstance(), mutable vs immutable).

How It Works:
• Python evaluates the expression or literal first, then applies the operation (e.g. type(), method call, or built-in).
• The result is returned or produced according to the semantics of that operation.

Step-by-Step Execution:
1. Any literals or subexpressions in the expression are evaluated (e.g. the argument to type(), or the string before a method call).
2. The main operation is applied (type lookup, method invocation, or built-in function).
3. The operation completes and returns a value (or None, if applicable).
4. In the REPL or in an assignment, the result is displayed or stored.

Order of Operations:
1. Literals and innermost subexpressions are evaluated first, from left to right where applicable.
2. Method calls or function calls are evaluated: arguments are evaluated left to right, then the call is performed.
3. The operation completes and produces its return value.
4. No other operators or operands remain in this expression once the call finishes.
5. Display or use of the result happens after the full expression has been evaluated.

2. Method calls or function calls are evaluated: arguments are evaluated left to right, then the call is performed.
3. The operation completes and produces its return value.
4. No other operators or operands remain in this expression once the call finishes.
5. Display or use of the result happens after the full expression has been evaluated.

Common Use Cases:
• Checking types or results in the REPL; teaching the concept to beginners; validating data before use.
• Using this pattern in scripts to branch on type or to ensure correct behavior with different inputs.

Edge Cases:
• See the explanation above for edge cases (e.g. empty values, None, subclasses, encoding, or boundary conditions).
• Consider what happens with empty collections, missing keys, or invalid arguments where applicable.

Performance Considerations:
• The operation is typically fast at beginner scale; built-in types and methods are highly optimized in CPython.
• For hot paths, prefer isinstance() over type() when subclasses are allowed; avoid repeated type checks in tight loops when possible.

Examples:
• See the example(s) above; try the same pattern with related values or similar expressions to reinforce understanding.

Notes:
• Use isinstance() when you need to allow subclasses; follow PEP 8 for naming and style; refer to the official docs for full details.`

3. The operation completes and returns a value (or None, if applicable).
4. In the REPL or in an assignment, the result is displayed or stored.

Order of Operations:
1. Literals and innermost subexpressions are evaluated first, from left to right where applicable.
2. Method calls or function calls are evaluated: arguments are evaluated left to right, then the call is performed.
3. The operation completes and produces its return value.
4. No other operators or operands remain in this expression once the call finishes.
5. Display or use of the result happens after the full expression has been evaluated.

Common Use Cases:
• Checking types or results in the REPL; teaching the concept to beginners; validating data before use.
• Using this pattern in scripts to branch on type or to ensure correct behavior with different inputs.

Edge Cases:
• See the explanation above for edge cases (e.g. empty values, None, subclasses, encoding, or boundary conditions).
• Consider what happens with empty collections, missing keys, or invalid arguments where applicable.

Performance Considerations:
• The operation is typically fast at beginner scale; built-in types and methods are highly optimized in CPython.
• For hot paths, prefer isinstance() over type() when subclasses are allowed; avoid repeated type checks in tight loops when possible.

Examples:
• See the example(s) above; try the same pattern with related values or similar expressions to reinforce understanding.

• "hello"[0:100] → "hello" (end is past the end, clamped to len)

• Python evaluates the expression or literal first, then applies the operation (e.g. type(), method call, or built-in).
• The result is returned or produced according to the semantics of that operation.

Step-by-Step Execution:
1. Any literals or subexpressions in the expression are evaluated (e.g. the argument to type(), or the string before a method call).
2. The main operation is applied (type lookup, method invocation, or built-in function).
3. The operation completes and returns a value (or None, if applicable).
4. In the REPL or in an assignment, the result is displayed or stored.

Order of Operations:
1. Literals and innermost subexpressions are evaluated first, from left to right where applicable.
2. Method calls or function calls are evaluated: arguments are evaluated left to right, then the call is performed.
3. The operation completes and produces its return value.
4. No other operators or operands remain in this expression once the call finishes.
5. Display or use of the result happens after the full expression has been evaluated.

Common Use Cases:
• Checking types or results in the REPL; teaching the concept to beginners; validating data before use.
• Using this pattern in scripts to branch on type or to ensure correct behavior with different inputs.

Edge Cases:
• See the explanation above for edge cases (e.g. empty values, None, subclasses, encoding, or boundary conditions).
• Consider what happens with empty collections, missing keys, or invalid arguments where applicable.

Performance Considerations:
• The operation is typically fast at beginner scale; built-in types and methods are highly optimized in CPython.
• For hot paths, prefer isinstance() over type() when subclasses are allowed; avoid repeated type checks in tight loops when possible.

Examples:
• See the example(s) above; try the same pattern with related values or similar expressions to reinforce understanding.

Notes:
• Use isinstance() when you need to allow subclasses; follow PEP 8 for naming and style; refer to the official docs for full details.`

• Access parts: (1+2j).real → 1.0, (1+2j).imag → 2.0
• Complex supports arithmetic: (1+2j) * (3+4j) → (-5+10j)
• complex(1, 2) also creates 1+2j

Example: type(1+2j) → <class 'complex'>. Python is one of few languages with built-in complex number support.

Key Concepts:
• See the key concepts and explanation above for the main ideas and bullet points.

Key Distinctions:
• Compare with related types (e.g. int vs float, str vs bytes) and similar operations or methods.
• Distinguish this operation or type from others that beginners might confuse (e.g. type() vs isinstance(), mutable vs immutable).

How It Works:
• Python evaluates the expression or literal first, then applies the operation (e.g. type(), method call, or built-in).
• The result is returned or produced according to the semantics of that operation.

Step-by-Step Execution:
1. Any literals or subexpressions in the expression are evaluated (e.g. the argument to type(), or the string before a method call).
2. The main operation is applied (type lookup, method invocation, or built-in function).
3. The operation completes and returns a value (or None, if applicable).
4. In the REPL or in an assignment, the result is displayed or stored.

Order of Operations:
1. Literals and innermost subexpressions are evaluated first, from left to right where applicable.
2. Method calls or function calls are evaluated: arguments are evaluated left to right, then the call is performed.
3. The operation completes and produces its return value.
4. No other operators or operands remain in this expression once the call finishes.
5. Display or use of the result happens after the full expression has been evaluated.

Common Use Cases:
• Checking types or results in the REPL; teaching the concept to beginners; validating data before use.
• Using this pattern in scripts to branch on type or to ensure correct behavior with different inputs.

Edge Cases:
• See the explanation above for edge cases (e.g. empty values, None, subclasses, encoding, or boundary conditions).
• Consider what happens with empty collections, missing keys, or invalid arguments where applicable.

Performance Considerations:
• The operation is typically fast at beginner scale; built-in types and methods are highly optimized in CPython.
• For hot paths, prefer isinstance() over type() when subclasses are allowed; avoid repeated type checks in tight loops when possible.

Examples:
• See the example(s) above; try the same pattern with related values or similar expressions to reinforce understanding.

Notes:
• Use isinstance() when you need to allow subclasses; follow PEP 8 for naming and style; refer to the official docs for full details.`
